## Hi there 👋

- I'm an AI and ML Engineer with a strong focus on building production grade artificial intelligence systems, scalable backend services, and applied generative AI. My work centers on turning research level models into reliable systems that handle real traffic, cost constraints, and performance targets.

## What I Do 🛠️
- I mostly work on backend AI systems involving LLMs, RAG pipelines, and agent based architectures, primarily using Python with FastAPI and Flask.

- Most of my work revolves around multi agent systems, MCP servers, and retrieval pipelines, where I design optimized document search, fine tuning workflows, and orchestration layers that improve latency, accuracy, and cost efficiency in production environments.

## Languages and core technologies
- Python + FastAPI / Flask (LLM, RAG, MCP, APIs)
- PyTorch, TensorFlow, LangChain, LangGraph
- Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, SageMaker, Azure OpenAI
- Vector databases, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Neo4j

## Cloud and AI stack
- I build and deploy AI systems on AWS and Azure using serverless and containerized architectures, integrating API Gateway, Lambda, SageMaker, and scalable storage to support thousands of daily requests with sub second latency.

## I am Interested in Working On 🔍
- Scalable generative AI systems
- Agentic and multi agent workflows
- Large scale RAG and knowledge graphs
- Model optimization, quantization, and fine tuning
- Practical AI that delivers measurable business impact
